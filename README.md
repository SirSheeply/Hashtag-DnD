# Hashtag-DnD Lite Edition
PLEASE SUPPORT the Original Creator: [Raeleus Hashtag-DnD](https://github.com/raeleus/Hashtag-DnD)

This Lite Edition has several goals:
1) Compatibility for other scripts (see the master branch for a raw compatibility version).
2) Create a lighter version of scripts (may have less features and content in exchange for smaller files, compatibility, and simplicity).
3) Add a few quality of life commands where needed, as well as uncapping or removing some restrictions.
