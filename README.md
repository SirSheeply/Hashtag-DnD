# Hashtag-DnD Lite Edition
PLEASE SUPPORT the Original Creator: [Raeleus Hashtag-DnD](https://github.com/raeleus/Hashtag-DnD)

This Lite Edition has several goals:
1) Compatibility for other scripts (see the master branch for a raw compatibility version).
2) Create a lighter version of scripts (may have less features and content in exchange for smaller files, compatibility, and simplicity).
3) Add a few quality of life commands where needed, as well as uncapping or removing some restrictions.
4) Improve customisation for users and dynamic generation of conent.
5) Improve readability and simplify code for modders.
